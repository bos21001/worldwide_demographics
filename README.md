# Overview

Welcome to worldwide_demographics analysis repository. In this repository I made my first try on analizing a set of data with Python Pandas library. I tried to have a simple view of a serie of charts to answer two questions.

The same .csv file this repository use with its description can be found at the link bellow:

# Data Analysis Results

The two questions and the answers are detailed here bellow.

* Does life expectancy increase or decrease according to the GNI?

According to the generated charts bellow GNI is not 100% linked to life expectancy.

* The total amount population of a continent is proportional to people internet access?

The total amount of population is not related or proportional to the amount population of a continent as shown in the chart bellow.
